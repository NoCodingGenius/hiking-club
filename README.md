# Hiking Club

Born out of a mutual love of hiking, the Mercurate Team's Hiking Club application is a place for folks to find and review trails, create journals about their hikes, and explore the natural world. This is the React front end of the site. You can find the API [here](https://github.com/mercurate-team/hiking-club-api).
